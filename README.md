# House-Properties-Tagging

This repository show how we train 5 EfficientNetB3 30 epochs finetune using Autogluon to predict whether input image have Surveillance camera (label 1), Car park (label 2), Car (label 3), Shrine (label 4), Garden (label 5) in House Properties Tagging Hackatron on 14 Mar 2022 to 18 Mar 2022.

Each model is trained to predict each class of label (E.g. first EfficientNetB0 is trained to predict whether input image have Surveillance camera or not)

In hackatron, we got 0.50988 F1 score in private dataset
